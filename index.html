                    <p><br>
                        The problems that are faced by our farmers due to animal attacks on their fields and weather conditions. Along with the current solutions and methods that have been adapted to address this problem.
 It describes project proposal and elucidates our methods of addressing this problem. wild animals may easily cause significant yield losses and provoke additional financial problems. Another aspect to consider is that wild animal crop protection requires a particularly cautious approach
<br>
To avoid such problems we would like to create an  electrical detector with SENSER to detect animals with in a minimum range of 300 meters 
 Maximum range of 3000 meters which is covered with a water proofed material which is placed in “scarecrow” .
This device is connected with an app called
 “FARMER FRIENDLY”. </p>

                            To eliminate the presence of farmers in field we introduce an alarm system in device

                        The emergence of technology and digitalization across the globe in every sector has demonstrated the potentially transformative impact of enormous progress. 
     It’s not just urban dwellers who are moving toward digital solutions, but rural ones as well. Their share has recently shot up to 48% in India. Considering that the majority of the rural population comes from a farming background, we can safely conclude that there has been an influx of smart farming technology that has brought about some large-scale innovations in the day-to-day lives of farmers. Smart farming is the latest technological breakthrough in the field of agriculture. Farmers have long tapped into technological breakthroughs to adapt their farming practices to changing times, and this era is no exception. Smart farming is the concept of farm management that uses Agtech or agritech or modern technology to automate inputs and increase the quality and quantity of outputs
